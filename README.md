Hello there! I'm İmren Danışman, an English teacher turned Front-End Developer who's been venturing into the world of programming for the past year. With a background of exploring numerous countries and an advanced command of English, I bring a unique perspective to the tech realm. I'm honing my skills in HTML, CSS, SCSS, JavaScript, and React, crafting both self-improvement and creative solutions. My educational background and coding enthusiasm shape my approach to crafting user-friendly and interactive interfaces. There's a common thread between my code and my students: fostering clear and effective communication.
